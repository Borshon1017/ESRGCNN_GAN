#### Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been popularly adopted in image super-resolution (SR). However, deep CNNs for SR often suffer from the instability of training, resulting in poor image SR performance. Gathering complementary contextual information can effectively overcome the problem. Along this line, we propose a coarse-to-fine SRCNN (CFSRCNN) to recover a high-resolution (HR) image from its low-resolution version. The proposed CFSRCNN consists of a stack of feature extraction blocks (FEBs), an enhancement block (EB), a construction block (CB) and, a feature refinement block (FRB) to learn a robust SR model. Specifically, the stack of FEBs learns the long- and short-path features, and then fuses the learned features by expending the effect of the shallower layers to the deeper layers to improve the representing power of learned features. A compression unit is then used in each FEB to distill important information of features so as to reduce the number of parameters. Subsequently, the EB utilizes residual learning to integrate the extracted features to prevent from losing edge information due to repeated distillation operations. After that, the CB applies the global and local LR features to obtain coarse features, followed by the FRB to refine the features to reconstruct a high-resolution image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high efficiency and good performance of our CFSRCNN model on benchmark datasets compared with state-of-the-art SR models. The code of CFSRCNN is accessible on https://github.com/hellloxiaotian/CFSRCNN.
