# ESRGCNN
## An enhanced super-resolution group CNN (ESRGCNN) is conducted by Chunwei Tian, Yixuan Yuan, Shichao Zhang, Chia-Wen Lin, Wangmeng Zuo, David Zhang, 2021. It is implemented by Pytorch. 

## This paper uses group convolutions and residual operations to enhance deep and wide correlations of different channels to implement an efficient SR network.

#### CNNs with strong learning abilities are widely chosen to resolve super-resolution problem. However, CNNs depend on deeper network architectures to improve performance of image super-resolution, which may increase computational cost in general. In this paper, we present an enhanced super-resolution group CNN (ESRGCNN) with a shallow architecture by fully fusing deep and wide channel features to extract more accurate low-frequency information in terms of correlations of different channels in single image super-resolution (SISR). Also, a signal enhancement operation in the ESRGCNN is useful to inherit more long-distance contextual information for resolving long-term dependency. An adaptive up-sampling operation is gathered into a CNN to obtain an image super-resolution model with low-resolution images of different sizes. Extensive experiments report that our ESRGCNN surpasses the state-of-the-arts in terms of SISR performance, complexity, execution speed, image quality evaluation and visual effect in SISR.
